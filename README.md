Homogenization framework for origami metamaterials

asymptoticHomogenization.py is the numerical implementation of asymptotic homogenization method on the Miura tessellation.

Energy-basedHomogenization.py is the numerical implementation of energy-based homogenization method on the Miura tessellation.

detailedMiura.py is the fully detailed Miura tessellation as a reference model.

The folder 'postProcessing' contains sample results of the above codes, which are effective elastic constants of Miura origami from asymptotic homogenization, energy-based homogenization, and the fully detailed model:

meshConvergence.py plots the mesh convergence results of the two homogenization methods.

initFoldAngle.py plots the variation of effective elastic constants as functions of the initial fold angle. It computes and plots the errors compared to the fully detailed model. Results and errors are compared with the literature.

creaseStiffness.py plots the variation of effective elastic constants as functions of the crease stiffness. Results are compared with the literature.
